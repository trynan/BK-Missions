# BK-Missions (Qt version)
Welcome to the Qt version of BK Missions! This is the most recent version, although nothing directly related to missions generation is different from the tk version, so they are interchangable. There is nothing in this version which is not in the tk version, just some slightly updated widget positions. There are some things this version does not have:
- No text boxes next to mission buttons
- No configurable default settings
- No configurable window size/font size settings

The reason for most of the omissions is that I don't think they were very necessary to include in the first place. However, the text boxes in particular were not included because they were difficult to get working with the buttons. If any of these features are heavily desired, I can try to add them back, but I think the minimal style of this version is nice.
